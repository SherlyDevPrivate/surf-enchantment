/**
 * Called before items are added to the player's inventory by Telekinesis.
 *
 * This event allows you to modify the list of items that will be added to the player's inventory
 * when Telekinesis is triggered. You can add, remove, or modify the items in the list as needed.
 *
 * Cancelling this event will prevent any items from being added to the player's inventory by Telekinesis.
 * Note that cancelling this event does not prevent the original item drop or experience drop from occurring;
 * it only prevents the items from being added to the player's inventory. The items will still drop in the world as normal.
